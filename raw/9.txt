The travel customer continues to become more demanding, more educated and more tech savvy. 
As a result, travel agencies and tour operators need to become more nimble and knowledgeable to continue to meet the needs of future customers. 
The higher-spending, experiential traveler will have access to information and technology – and they will demand a higher level of services and products. 
Customers of the future are more likely to choose travel companies that protect the interests of travelers, understand their needs, use the same technologies, and understand their habits and buying patterns. 
In response, travel companies will need to keep pace with the tools and technology to appropriately manage this growing segment of the travel business that places more demands on providers and packagers of travel services. 
Join Tnooz, American Express and PhoCusWright for a FREE webinar that explores the trends that will shape travel and travelers for the future. 
This webinar took place on Thursday 14 August 2014.
