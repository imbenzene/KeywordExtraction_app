Waldorf Astoria is getting experiential about driving and this has nothing to do with Uber, Lyft, Curb, 
RelayRides or FlightCar, but has a lot to do with the Ferrari 458 Italia Spider, the McLaren MP4-12C and Porsche 911 Turbo. 
In partnership with US DXL, Waldorf Astoria properties in Park City, Utah; Palm Springs, California; Scottsdale and Phoenix, Arizona; Boca Raton, Florida, and New Orleans will offer the Waldorf Astoria Driving Experience at $999 per couple on select dates in late September through December 2014. 
At each property, the guests will get an orientation to the super cars from Didier Theys, a tour guide and Belgian racing champion, and then will set out on predefined routes. 
In Utah, for example, the three-hour drive is slated to take in Provo Canyon and Bridal Veil Falls. Each route will have three stops so that participants can sample each of the vehicles. 
The Waldorf Astoria Driving Experience is part of an experiential trend driving hotel development and operations across the globe tailored to the preferences of diverse demographics. 
While some Millennials just starting out in their careers might want a hotel to offer an experience revolving around the local arts or foodie scene, Waldorf Astoria, a Hilton Worldwide brand, is creating experiences that mesh with the likes of its sometimes-more upscale clientele. 
The Waldorf Astoria Driving Experience has certain parallels with InterContinental Hotels’ weekend escape packages featuring photography lessons with an award-winning photographer.
