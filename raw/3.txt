At least 1.1 billion people globally have a disability, controlling over $4 trillion annually – a market the size of China. 
Whatever your niche, that’s a big slice of potential business that simply can’t be overlooked. 
Are you turning away business because your website isn’t accessible? 
Many travel businesses are doing what they can to accommodate disabled people at their destination, and every carrier is geared up for disabled travellers. But many potential customers struggle to research and book their travel online. 
Many businesses know about the legal risk of not having an accessible website but are unaware of the enormous commercial implications. 
AbilityNet is a global leader in the use of technology by disabled people and has provided accessibility services to businesses such as HSBC, BT and Microsoft. 
The UK-based, non-profit organisation recently tested the websites of some of the leading travel businesses and airlines and found that none were legally compliant, and that all of them present barriers to potential customers. 
Join Tnooz and AbilityNet for our FREE TLearn webinar and explore the results of the tests, the size and shape of the marketplace and lessons to be learned by everyone in the travel sector. 
This webinar took place on Thursday 7 August 2014.
